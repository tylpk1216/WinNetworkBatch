## WinNetworkBatch
Use Windows Batch File to change network interface.

## Why
I usually work on Windows PC. Sometimes I need to use Wi-Fi to connect to another Linux PC. I must disable my Lan network and enable my Wi-Fi network manually. When colleages ask me some questions, I must change my network interface again. This is a boring job. So I decide to use Windows Batch File to simplify my work. Jus for fun.

## Windows 10 (I only have Chinese Windows 10, please image it!)
The 'netsh' command needs administrator privilege to use it. I use steps below to chain my steps smoothly.
1. Add shortcut to my batch file.
2. Click mouse right botton to 'property' -> 'shortcut' -> 'advanced options'.
3. Then check 'Run as administrator'.
